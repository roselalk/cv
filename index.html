          <p> <em>Neuropsychology Graduate and Aspiring Software Engineer</em></p>
          <p>I am a recent Neuropsychology graduate from Utrecht University, where I completed my degree with Honours. During the course of my studies, I naturally gravitated towards IT-related work. During my second year of my Bachelor's, I took two
            courses
            on Python. Outside of class, I started learning how to code in other languages, such as HTML, CSS and Javascript. In my work as administrative coordinator at Moll Academy I also started taking on more and more IT-related tasks, such as
            curating
            our database on a daily basis and building the two websites used for the company. After graduating, I realised it was not a career in Neuropsychology I wanted to pursue, but instead one in IT! Read more about my background, motivation,
            and

  <h3>See My Work</h3>
  <p>These are the websites that I created for the company Moll Academy. I built the websites using the website builder SquareSpace, and used my knowledge of HTML and CSS to alter the appearance of the website; such as adding a border around a piece
    of text, or changing the amount of time the sliding questions on the homepage appear before sliding to the next.</p>
